## Description

The SSH Project (0x0B) by ALX aims to provide users with practical solutions and best practices for working with SSH in various scenarios. From creating SSH key pairs to configuring client settings, this repository covers a range of tasks to help you manage SSH connections efficiently.

## Scripts Overview

1. **Use a Private Key (`0-use_a_private_key`):** A Bash script that uses SSH to connect to a server using a specified private key and username. The script adheres to strict requirements, utilizing only single-character flags for SSH options.

2. **Create an SSH Key Pair (`1-create_ssh_key_pair`):** A Bash script that generates an RSA key pair with the specified parameters, including the number of bits and passphrase protection.

3. **Client Configuration File (`2-ssh_config`):** Provides a sample SSH client configuration file that is configured to use a specific private key and refuse password authentication. This configuration enhances security and convenience when connecting to SSH servers.

4. **Let Me In (`3-let_me_in`):** This task involves adding a public SSH key to a server's authorized keys file, allowing access using the specified username.

5. **Client Configuration File with Puppet (`100-puppet_ssh_config.pp`):** Demonstrates the use of Puppet for managing SSH client configuration. This script ensures that the client is set up to use the designated private key and disable password authentication.

## Usage

To use these scripts and configurations, simply clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired directory. Ensure you have appropriate permissions to execute the scripts. Refer to each script's documentation for specific usage instructions and requirements.

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssh-project.git
cd ssh-project/0x0B-ssh
./0-use_a_private_key
\`\`\`
